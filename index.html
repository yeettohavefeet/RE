        <h4>Back in 1974, Disney students were housed at Neil Armstrong School while awaiting completion of this facility. The district had asked the students who would attend the new school to select a name. The criteria for the name selection was that this be an American hero. The students voted to name the new school after Walt Disney, the man who had brought so many wonderful children's films into existence. Learn more about Walt Disney. There are three Walt Disney Elementary schools in California. The other two are in Anaheim (the home of Disneyland) and Burbank (the home of Disney studios).
